## Study Case
Some features are needed to be added, such as:
- Simple feature to implement the discount (5%) to the existing subscribed users when they *upgrade* their plan, with t&c that their existing duration plan is more than 12 months.
- Implement special discount (4%) to potentially new users when they use referral code from existing users.
